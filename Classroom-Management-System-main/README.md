## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.



## Folder Structure

- src/
  - Main.java
  - models/
    - Admin.java
    - Staff.java
    - Student.java
  - services/
    - AdminService.java
    - StaffService.java
    - StudentService.java
  - utils/
    - CSVUtils.java
  - data/
    - students.csv
    - staffs.csv
    - schedules.csv
    - attendance.csv
    - feedback.csv
    - admin.csv
  - ui/
    - AdminUI.java
    - StaffUI.java
    - StudentUI.java
``


The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
